TASK 2 - Tiered, Regulated Data Lake Architecture

2.1 Summary

Design a secure, multi-zone data lake:
Raw Zone – exact copy of data, immutable, encrypted
Curated Zone – standardized, partially PHI redacted, versioned
QLM-Ready Zone – fully PHI redacted, hashed, minimal normalized fields

2.2 Storage Zones & Azure Mapping

| Zone      | Description                                  | Azure Implementation   |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Raw       | Exact copy, immutable, encrypted             | ADLS Gen2 + WORM       |
| Curated   | Standardized, validated, partial PHI removal | ADLS Gen2 + Delta Lake |
| QLM-Ready | Fully PHI redacted, hashed                   | ADLS Gen2 + Delta Lake |

2.3 RBAC

| Role               | Raw Zone | Curated Zone | QLM-Ready Zone | Logs | API |
| ------------------ | -------- | ------------ | -------------- | ---- | --- |
| Data Engineer      | ✔        | ✔            | ✔              | ✔    | ✔   |
| Data Scientist     | ✘        | ✔            | ✔              | ✘    | ✘   |
| Compliance Officer | ✔        | ✔            | ✘              | ✔    | ✔   |
| Analyst            | ✘        | ✘            | ✔              | ✘    | ✘   |

2.4 Versioning & Audit

Delta Lake tables on ADLS Gen2 (Curated & QLM zones)
Every write produces: commit logs, snapshots, time travel
Audit logs track: access, modifications, PHI redaction version, pipeline version
Logs stored in immutable WORM storage

2.5 Compliance Mapping

| Regulation  | How Solution Meets It                                             |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| HIPAA       | PHI removal, RBAC, encryption                                     |
| FDA         | Full data lineage, integrity verification, reproducible pipelines |
| CFR Part 11 | Timestamped transformations, immutable logs                       |
| Security    | Encryption, RBAC, network segmentation                            |
